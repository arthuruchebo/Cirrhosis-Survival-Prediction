# Cirrhosis-Survival-Prediction
Predicting cirrhosis survival using machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest and Decision Tree, implemented in a Colab notebook.

# Cirrhosis Prediction using Machine Learning
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict cirrhosis outcomes. The notebook explores various algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes, KNN and SVM to build a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `cirrhosis_data.csv` which you can find in this repository.

## Libraries Used
This notebook uses the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* xgboost

## Methodology
The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing data distributions and exploring relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** Evaluating machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The XGBoost model achieved the best results
